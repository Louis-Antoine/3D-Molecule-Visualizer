# 3D Molecule Visualizer (OpenGL)
Visualize molecule structures in 3D from real scientific data. <br>
This project was done as part of Concordia's Computer Graphics course (COMP371) in the winter 2023 semester (but just now published on github).

# Process
I picked molecule structural data from [Chemspider](https://www.chemspider.com/) and wrote a [.mol file parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_table_file) to generate the goemetry of the molecule.<br>
Different molecules can be chosen from a basic interface.

# Some Examples
